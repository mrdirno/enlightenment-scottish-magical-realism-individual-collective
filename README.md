### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Ishbel discovers a 'whispering' artifact in the Edinburgh New Town that holds a suppressed Enlightenment memory.
- Create a scene where Shona explains the 'collective' nature of the city's memory to a skeptical young urban planner.
- Draft a monologue from the perspective of the tenement building itself, feeling the new fracture Ishbel has discovered.
- Write a modern-day encounter where Ishbel uses her grandfather's methods to resolve a community dispute by 'listening' to the land.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a web experience that maps the novel's 'whispers' onto a real map of Glasgow, triggering audio clips of found text at specific coordinates.
- Create a generative text tool that mimics the 'collective voice' of the city, blending historical quotes, folklore, and architectural descriptions.
